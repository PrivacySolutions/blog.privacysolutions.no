Today we launched the I2P router and the Bote messaging system on Google Play in Norway. We tought that would be the perfect test country after PST's statements earlier this week. Mass surveillance is never a solution. I honestly tought PST was working for us and not against us. (no wonder they are in need of new employees at the moment, clearly they are in deep need of smart people who understand how wrong this is.)

Put simply I2P is a mix-network which routes your and the traffic of others trough themselves, making the traffic extremely hard to trace. It also utilizes what the US has dubbed "military encryption". In addition it is important to keep in mind that I2P doesn't query some centralized source to obtain optimal pathways, it's a self learning router which means your speed will increase as you allow it to run and "explore" the I2P-network. Inside I2P you find a free, uncensored internet with webpages, chats, torrent communities and numerous services of all kinds. I2P for Android has been released several times before, but only from the official pages at <a href="_blank" href="https://geti2p.net">https://geti2p.net</a>.

Privacy is nothing that is granted or bestowed upon us. Our every move is subject to surveillance and exploitation. We have to aknowledge and defend our right to privacy if we are to truly free ourselves and others.

You can find I2P and Bote on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+Privacy+Solutions+Project" target="_blank">Google play</a> at writing time.

For people outside of Norway, you can find the same I2P router as launched on Google Play at <a href="https://geti2p.net" target="_blank">https://geti2p.net</a> downloads section.

At last, we will post weekly news starting on Monday about happenings in the development progress and general.
